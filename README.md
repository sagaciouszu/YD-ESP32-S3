# YD-ESP32-S3 Core Board

###### Introduction:

The YD-ESP32-S3 core board is designed by VCC-GND Studio. If necessary, you can visit www.vcc-gnd.com to purchase it. This device uses the ESP32-S3 chip, which can be used for testing prototypes of Internet of Things applications and can also be used for practical applications. It is equipped with two USBs, one is a hardware USB-to-serial port (CH343P WCH Qinheng), and the other is ESP32-S3 USB port.

This guide will help you quickly get started with YD-ESP32-S3 and provide detailed information about this development board.

YD-ESP32-S3 is an entry-level development board equipped with Wi-Fi + BluetoothÂ® LE module ESP32-S3-WROOM-1.

Most of the pins of the on-board module have been led out to the pin headers on both sides of the development board. Developers can easily connect various peripheral devices through jumpers according to actual needs, or the development board can be plugged into a breadboard for use.

1. This is the minimum core board of ESP32-S3, using the ESP32-S3 module of Espressif Systems.
2. LDO circuit dedicated for wireless function, no need to worry about insufficient current (power).
3. Equipped with a WS2812-RGB LED (note that it is not lit directly through GPIO).
4. The RST button is used for the external reset function and the boot button (with the rst button, it can be booted into the bootloard mode. After reset, it can be used as a user button, which is GPIO0).
5. You will find that the board has two TYPE-C interfaces (one is directly connected to USB (GPIO19 GPIO20), and the other is a USB port for USB to serial port), equipped with a hardware USB to serial port chip (CH343).

Micropython firmware download:

The download and erase tool software flash_download_tool_3.9.2_0 for ESP32-S3 is download tool under win.
Note: There is no need to install and decompress. Double-click the small gear logo, select ESP32-S3, develop, USART, and look at the rest of the picture. Note that the starting address is 0x00, and there is a check mark in front. If it cannot be downloaded, it may be that the USB to serial port driver is not installed properly. Fix the driver problem first and then download.

![](/IMG/img3.png)

Notice:

You cannot use the so-called ESP32 downloader that comes with thonny to download micropython firmware for ESP32-S3 (the one that comes with thonny is for esp32, the model is not esp32-s3, and the address is not 0x00 of S3 but 0x1000 of ESP32), nor You cannot use the SPRAM firmware officially downloaded by micropython, and it cannot be used normally after downloading. The correct download method is to use Espressif's official flash tool download tool, select ESP32-S3 serial port download (USART), insert the USB into the COM port of the board, and select The starting address of the corresponding firmware (the firmware we adapted from the source) is 0x00. Check the box before selecting the firmware. It is best to erase it first and then download it.
The firmware is a link that starts with 1- and the firmware download software is a link that starts with 2-. Please note that it is best to update the CH343usb to serial port hardware driver before use. Note that in the data link that starts with 0-, confirm that it appears in the device manager. Only if...CH343 is marked COM.

If you download TASMOTA firmware, TASMOTA officially has its own web download.

###### Problems with copycats/counterfeits/low-quality imitations:

There are many copycat/counterfeit/low-quality imitations of our origin (YD) development boards, and Shenzhen Huaqiangbei is the most rampant. The common method used by copycats is to directly polish our development boards and take photos and copy them, resulting in many hidden dangers in copycat products. Now we summarize the dangers (hidden dangers) of buying fake boards.
Take the YD-ESP32 (ESP32/S2/S3/C3) series as an example:

1. In order to further pursue profits, copycat manufacturers often use refurbished and unofficial devices, arbitrarily replacing them with cheap models of the same package, and randomly selecting models for profit.

2. The 2812 lamp does not weld the signal and cannot be used. This proves from the side that the plagiarists do not check the board to save trouble and reduce costs.

3. Counterfeit boards are not inspected before leaving the factory (to reduce costs). They are packaged as soon as they come off the production line and sent to consumers, saving links and maximizing profits.

4. Due to plagiarized photos and many silk screen printing errors, counterfeit boards can easily mislead consumers, and the plagiarists themselves cannot understand them.

5. The copied version of the copycat board is version 1.2, which is an early version in 2022, and the genuine version is version 1.4. The copycat board cannot use the updated functions, so it saves trouble and does not improve.

6. The copycat board uses a third-party "copycat" module (low cost). The copycat module has not been impedance matched. When using WIFI Bluetooth, the power consumption is high, the signal is poor, and it is easy to crash.

7. Since we canât find our dedicated LDO on the market for copycat boards, we randomly choose inappropriate models, such as 1117 (low cost), which have large pressure differences, are prone to crashes, and have poor signals.

8. The counterfeit board uses diodes with high voltage difference (greater than 0.7V tube voltage drop, low cost), resulting in insufficient back-end LDO voltage difference, further causing high power consumption, easy crash, and poor signal.

9. The copycat board does not provide basic technology, and even the information is directly copied from ours (the information is still from our early days, and the copycats are too lazy to find the latest information). After receiving the money, they donât care.

10. Sometimes there is a problem when starting the copycat board. It directly enters the BootLoader, making it unusable. The copycat board does not understand what the problem is!

11. Because the counterfeit boards are copied from photos, there are no schematics, which makes users unable to understand how to use them, and neither do the counterfeiters, making the product difficult to use.


Some counterfeiters directly print the words YD-ESP32 and other words on the counterfeit boards to confuse the public. What's worse, some even print our official website WWW.VCC-GND.COM on the counterfeit products. This behavior has triggered relevant laws. , we will definitely pursue the case, please consumers do not covet a few cents ~ a few yuan to bear the above risks, waste time and energy in vain, support the source and support genuine products, please look for the source when purchasing, VCC-GND trademark .

###### Any function on the pin can be realized through the internal switching matrix:

In the introduction of various ESP32 series documents, it is noted that it has various peripheral communication functions such as I2C, I2S, UART, SPI, etc. However, the schematic diagram of the function pins does not indicate which pins these functions are. This question is answered in the peripheral pin allocation. Peripheral interfaces such as I2C, I2S, UART, and SPI can be defined as any GPIO pin, so there is no need to mark it on the functional diagram. Anyway, any GPIO can be These peripheral interface I2C, I2S, UART, and SPI pins can be given certain pin functions.
